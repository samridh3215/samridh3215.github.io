This project was more about getting familiar with the protocol about building software, rather than actually building it.

It is a small project that tries to mimic online portals at any university.

It involved planning out functional and non functional requirements, choosing the right kind of development life cycle, modeling out the requirements with diagrams (use-case diagram, data flow diagram and many other). And most importantly we learnt how to collaborate with team members and use version control tools such as git to seamlessly work on large projects without any issues.
